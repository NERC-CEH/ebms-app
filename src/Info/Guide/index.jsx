        <H>How to use the app</H>
        <P>
          You can use this app to monitor butterflies anywhere in Europe. The
          results will be entered into the European Butterfly Monitoring
          database and used to develop trends of butterflies across Europe. To
          use the app you will first have to register an account.
        </P>
        <P>
          The preferred method is to conduct a 15-minute Count. This can be done
          at any place and at any time when butterflies are active (i.e. when
          the weather is warm and preferably sunny). You can also use the app to
          record your established butterfly transects. Later in 2020, the app
          will also include the ability to submit casual records. The notes
          below tell you how to use the currently available methods.

      <Section>
        <H>How to do a 15-minute Count</H>
        <P>
          This is the default method on the app. Simply count butterflies for a
          15 minute period, either in a defined area such as a field, or while
          walking along, or standing on a fixed point counting butterflies that
          fly past. There is no need to draw the route as the app will know your
          route, provided you have the GPS tracking facility switched on in your
          Settings. Otherwise you will have to draw the area searched on a map,
          using the app. To start, touch the + button at the bottom of the
          screen. The app counts down the 15 minutes once you have started, but
          you can pause at any time (for example to identify a butterfly) by
          pressing the pause button. At the end of the survey you can review
          your records and make sure the totals are correct before submitting.
        </P>
        <P>
          Add species you see by pressing the + ADD button and start typing a
          species name. The selection of species will then appear as a drop down
          menu. You can use either scientific or English names. Select the
          species you see and once in your list of butterflies, touch the left
          hand number to increase the count of how many you have seen. You can
          review this number and amend at the end as well. You can also add
          photos if you want and add comments.
        </P>
        <P>
          Once you have finished your 15-minute Count and checked that the
          species and numbers seen are correct, press the UPLOAD button to
          submit. This is important to make sure your data is stored securely in
          the eBMS database. A record of the count will be held on your device
          for future reference as well as on your online account.

        <H>How to record along an existing transect</H>
        <P>
          You can also use the app to submit records while walking an existing
          butterfly monitoring transect. These have already been established by
          country Butterfly Monitoring Schemes and are best completed by
          experienced recorders. Recording existing transects within the app
          requires that your account is already linked to a transect setup
          within the eBMS system. If no transect sites are listed once you are
          logged into the app, please contact your national co-ordinator (please
          email {{ helpEmail }} for advice).
        </P>
        <P>
          To start with the transect count, hold down the + button (a
          long-press) at the bottom of the screen and select eBMS Transect. The
          Transect page will appear with all the options to be completed. First,
          you have to select your transects (you will need to be logged in for
          this, and for transect routes to be linked to your user account). Once
          you have selected your transect site, you can fill out the necessary
          weather details (e.g. temperature, wind speed etc) and other required
          information (e.g. start time) on the Transect page. You then add a
          list of species seen and the number counted for each transect section,
          in the same way as for a 15-minute count. Once you have finished your
          Transect and checked that the species and numbers seen are correct,
          press the FINISH button to submit.

            In this tab, on the right part of the + Button, you can see the
            PENDING counts, your records that have not been submitted and the
            UPLOADED counts, the ones submitted to the eBMS database. The
            Pending counts can be submitted to the system by clicking on it and
            pressing the Upload option. You could see the species list that you
            recorded for Uploaded counts. All your records can also be viewed
            and edited on the {{ eBMSWebsiteLink }}
