"The Clouded Apollo occurs in mountainous regions on damp to moderately dry "

"The Large Copper occurs in marshy habitats, and on the peaty banks of lakes,"
" rivers and streams. Nectar plants are important for the females, which lay "
"more eggs when there is more food available for them. Eggs are laid on large"
" sorrels (Rumex spp.). The young caterpillars first eat from the underside "
"of the leaves, making the characteristic ‘windows’. Later caterpillars feed "
"on the whole leaf. They hibernate when half-grown between withered leaves at"
" the foot of the foodplant. The Large Copper has several sub-species in "
"Europe. The largest, L. d. batava, is confined to extensive wetlands in The "
"Netherlands. Their caterpillars feed only on Water Dock (Rumex "
"hydrolapathum). The two smaller subspecies (L. d. rutila and L. d. carueli) "
