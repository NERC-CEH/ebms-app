msgid ""
"You can use this app to monitor butterflies anywhere in Europe. The results "

"develop trends of butterflies across Europe. To use the app you will first "
"have to register an account."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The preferred method is to conduct a 15-minute Count. This can be done at "
"any place and at any time when butterflies are active (i.e. when the weather"
" is warm and preferably sunny). You can also use the app to record your "
"established butterfly transects. The notes below tell you how to use the "
"currently available methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to do a 15-minute Count"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the default method on the app. Simply count butterflies for a 15 "
"minute period, either in a defined area such as a field, or while walking "
"along, or standing on a fixed point counting butterflies that fly past. "
"There is no need to draw the route as the app will know your route, provided"
" you have the GPS tracking facility switched on in your Settings. Otherwise "
"you will have to draw the area searched on a map, using the app. To start, "
"touch the + button at the bottom of the screen. The app counts down the 15 "
"minutes once you have started, but you can pause at any time (for example to"
" identify a butterfly) by pressing the pause button. At the end of the "
"survey you can review your records and make sure the totals are correct "
"before submitting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add species you see by pressing the + ADD button and start typing a species "
"name. The selection of species will then appear as a drop down menu. You can"
" use either scientific or English names. Select the species you see and once"
" in your list of butterflies, touch the left hand number to increase the "
"count of how many you have seen. You can review this number and amend at the"
" end as well. You can also add photos if you want and add comments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have finished your 15-minute Count and checked that the species and"
" numbers seen are correct, press the UPLOAD button to submit. This is "
"important to make sure your data is stored securely in the eBMS database. A "
"record of the count will be held on your device for future reference as well"
" as on your online account."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to record along an existing transect"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the app to submit records while walking an existing "
"butterfly monitoring transect. These have already been established by "
"country Butterfly Monitoring Schemes and are best completed by experienced "
"recorders. Recording existing transects within the app requires that your "
"account is already linked to a transect setup within the eBMS system. If no "
"transect sites are listed once you are logged into the app, please contact "
"your national co-ordinator (please email {{helpEmail}} for advice)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To start with the transect count, hold down the + button (a long-press) at "
"the bottom of the screen and select eBMS Transect. The Transect page will "
"appear with all the options to be completed. First, you have to select your "
"transects (you will need to be logged in for this, and for transect routes "
"to be linked to your user account). Once you have selected your transect "
"site, you can fill out the necessary weather details (e.g. temperature, wind"
" speed etc) and other required information (e.g. start time) on the Transect"
" page. You then add a list of species seen and the number counted for each "
"transect section, in the same way as for a 15-minute count. Once you have "
"finished your Transect and checked that the species and numbers seen are "
"correct, press the FINISH button to submit."
